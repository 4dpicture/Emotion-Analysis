I collated suggestions from dozens of past posts and comments on these topics. I've used feminine pronouns and made this female-centric because I'm a female writing from my own perspective, but almost all of these ideas would be appropriate for a male or non-binary person diagnosed with breast cancer as well. I hope others will chime in, and I'm happy to add more ideas or edit my original post based on the comments.\\n\\n## Supporting a Loved one Through Breast Cancer\\n\\nTHE BEST GIFT you can give a cancer patient is continuing to acknowledge her as a unique individual incredible WHOLE person, and not as \\\"a cancer patient.\\\" Maintain the relationship you had before diagnosis -- if you used to text each other memes, keep texting her memes. If you used to get the kids together for playdates, offer to keep the playdates, modifying as necessary to accommodate her treatment and side effects. If you used to call her on your way home from work to joke and complain about the annoying customers you dealt with that day, don't be scared to keep that tradition alive.\\n\\nLet her know you want to help. Offer specific types of help, so she doesn't have to do the mental load of giving you tasks, but also leave an opening for her to specify something you didn't think of. *\\\"I want to help. Can I \\\\[insert 3-5 ideas\\\\]? But if there's something even more helpful to you, let me know.\\\"*\\n\\nThese gift ideas are just ideas -- everything is something that an actual cancer survivor on r/breastcancer has recommended, but for every idea here, another survivor might say the gift wouldn't have been useful to her. I've bolded the ideas that generally everyone can agree on, but you know your person best. If you're not sure she'd like something, ask her! *\\\"I want to buy you \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_. Is that something you could use?\\\"*\\n\\n## Emotional Support Crash Course\\n\\n* Google each of these phrases and read whichever articles catch your eye: \\\"emotional validation,\\\" \\\"emotional mirroring,\\\" \\\"toxic positivity, \\\"ring theory.\\\"\\n* Generally, today's cancer patients prefer not to metaphorize cancer as a fight/battle in which there are winners/losers, but follow her lead and let her set the tone when discussing her diagnosis and treatment.\\n* \\\"So many friends and family members kind of disappear from our lives, because they don't know what to say or do, so they just avoid. It hurts so much more than you know when that happens. **So many of the people she expects to be there for her won't be, and people she doesn't expect will be the ones to step up. Be one of those who's totally there for her, and be willing to hear the tough stuff.** It's exhausting to try to keep up a positive mood for other people all the time, and that's what we, as the patient try to do for everyone. We realize, unfortunately, that most people really don't want to hear the negative when they ask how we're doing... be willing to hear the negative. It will be such a relief to her.\\\" ([Jeepgrl563, 3/27/21](https://www.reddit.com/r/breastcancer/comments/mel5t2/how_can_i_support_a_relative/gsiirgh/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))\\n* [TheCancerPatient on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thecancerpatient/) can be hilarious and apropos, and many of the memes are a primer on \\\"what not to say to a cancer patient.\\\"\\n\\n## Acts of Service\\n\\n* **Drive her to her appointments**\\n* Deliver lunch during long chemotherapy sessions\\n* Babysit her kids during her appointments, or be on-call to get the kids from daycare/school if she can't get there on time because an appointment ran late\\n* Set up a meal train (get her blessing before you invite anyone to contribute, as she might want to keep her diagnosis private for awhile)\\n* Deliver a freezer meal\\n* Deliver a ready-to-eat meal at dinnertime\\n* Invite her family to join you for a meal\\n* Ask for her family's favorite meal recipe, and cook that for them\\n* Ask for her kids' favorite cookie recipe, and bake that for them\\n* When you're grocery shopping for your own home, send her a text and ask if there's anything she wants you to pick up for her\\n* Pick up and deliver prescriptions/medications as needed\\n* Take out her garbage\\n* Offer to \\\"screen her mail\\\" and throw away obvious junk and offensive mail (for Stage 4 cancer survivors, life insurance offers and retirement benefits add insult to injury)\\n* Offer to pick up a load of laundry to wash/dry/fold at your home\\n* [Help her make Christmas magical, if Christmas is important to her (tons of ideas at this link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/breastcancer/comments/rewuhr/cancer_for_christmas_if_you_have_a_friend/)\\n* Take her kids on an outing (e.g. children's museum, arcade, movie theater, baseball game)\\n* Entertain her kids at her house with an activity at her home (e.g. bake/decorate cookies, kid-friendly craft projects, board games, play catch, create an elaborate hopscotch obstacle course); invite her to join in, watch, or escape; if she chooses to join in, take candid action photos of her with her kids\\n* Commit to walking her dog on a regular basis, and invite her to walk with you when she's feeling up to it!\\n* Do one light cleaning task every time you stop by (e.g. wipe a counter, load the dishwasher, do a lap with the vacuum -- but keep it short and sweet and she won't feel so awkward accepting your help)\\n* Offer to help launder sheets and remake beds (this is an especially exhausting chore!)\\n* If she's an avid reader, here are two ideas to ensure you have something non-cancer related to text/talk about: (1) coordinate with her friends to each give her a copy of their favorite book every 3-4 weeks during treatment, (2) buy two copies of the same book and do a \\\"buddy read\\\" together\\n* Set up a videogame for her to conquer during recovery, whether she's an avid or newbie gamer (e.g. Skyrim)\\n* Send a box full of individually wrapped trinkets that have nothing to do with cancer, and just celebrate her, your relationship, and your shared sense of humor; instruct her to open one any time she's having a hard day\\n* Create a personalized playlist for her to listen to during treatment\\n\\n## Gifts Appropriate for All Treatment Stages\\n\\n* **Gift cards to meal delivery services or local restaurants that deliver**\\n* **Gift cards to her local grocery store**\\n* Hire a cleaning service to come every other week (or weekly if there are children at home all day)\\n* Hire a landscape service to do routine lawncare\\n* Schedule a beloved and energetic babysitter to play with the kids regularly.\\n* Gift cards for doggy day care day passes\\n* Gift cards to a local meal prep store that sells pre-made dinner kits\\n* Gift cards to her favorite nail salon\\n* If she normally relies on public transit, Uber/Lyft gift cards so she can get around with minimal germ exposure\\n* Subscription to a streaming service she doesn't already have (if she likes TV, ask which streaming service she'd like to try, if she's a reader ask if she would like an Audible subscription)\\n* Fun pens & beautiful forever stamps, so she'll remember someone loves her every time her medical bills bleed her dry\\n* Random cards mailed throughout the year, so she'll have something cute and fun among the bills in her mailbox\\n* Novelty band-aids, so she'll remember someone loves her every time she gets stabbed with a needle\\n* Soup bowl with a handle, so she can eat soup in bed (\\\\~30 ounce capacity is ideal)\\n* Micellar facial wet wipes, so she can clean her face without leaving bed\\n* Floss picks, so she can floss her teeth without leaving bed\\n* Storage clipboard, for all the paperwork she'll get at each appointment\\n* eReader, if she's an avid reader (e.g. Kindle / Kobo)\\n* Water bottle (note: she may already have a favorite!)\\n* Satin or silk pillowcase -- can reduce tangles when spending more time in bed and less time on self care, and will be soothing on tender scalps during chemo shedding\\n* Electric heat pad\\n* Microwave-activated moist heating pad (e.g. Thermalon)\\n* **10-foot phone charging cable**\\n* **Power bank (10000mAh or greater), so she can charge her phone/tablet without being tethered to an outlet**\\n* Comfy pajamas that are stylish enough to wear to treatments\\n* Journal\\n* Fruit bouquet (e.g. Edible Arrangements)\\n* Mepilex Lite Absorbent Foam Pads\\n* Bidet attachment for the toilet\\n* Digital thermometer\\n* Epsom salt\\n\\n## Specific Comfort Items for each Stage of Treatment\\n\\n## Chemotherapy\\n\\n* Gift card to a microblading salon/spa, if she has time to get the service done before she starts chemo\\n\\n## Chemo Infusions\\n\\n* Sour or minty candy, so the saline port flush tastes less gross\\n* Comfortable shirt that allows access to her port (e.g. zip-front hoodie, deep scoop shirt)\\n\\n## Chemo Recovery\\n\\n* Sour suckers, if she has nausea (e.g. Preggie Pop Drops, Queasy Pops)\\n* Ginger chews, if she has nausea (e.g. Gin Gins, Trader Joes)\\n* Travel pill organizer, with room for her to store a lot of pills in each compartment and label each compartment (NOT a daily pill organizer that is labelled by the day with tiny compartments -- look for one that is at least 5\\\" x 4\\\")\\n* Dry mouth relief (tablets, spray, gel, etc.)\\n* Biotene toothpaste, if she gets mouth sores\\n* Soft bristle toothbrush\\n* tea, especially anti-nausea tea;

I was diagnosed on 11/3. Chemo started 12/22. Surgery 5/23 and today marks the end of five weeks of radiation!\\n\\nI will never forget the day my aunt (a MD) read my biopsy report. She said - you are going to battle this year. It\\u2019s going to take everything you\\u2019ve got to get through it, but you will. \\n\\nTo those of you at the beginning of this hard mountain climb, you can do it too. \\n\\nThank you to the countless internet hugs, laughs, encouraging words, photos of foobs, photos of hair, etc. You\\u2019ve shown me that goodness exists. \\ud83e\\ude77\",\n          \"Edit: Further down you'll read me bitching about fatigue and how I had barely been functional all day. Well, today I went to take my meds as I always do (for a zillion non cancer things), but this time I actually paid attention and realized that the pill that should have been my Adderall (ADHD) was the wrong color. Grabbed the bottle. Yep, it was trazadone. You know, the stuff they gave me because I'd been having trouble sleeping a while ago. So yeah, Julie used trazadone! It was super effective!\\n\\nAnyway, that cracked me up and made me wonder just how interesting I'm going to be when chemo brain hits! Today I took my Adderall and moved the trazadone bottle back to where it was supposed to be. The fatigue is still real but it's a relief to know that days like yesterday probably are not going to be the norm. At least, not yet.\\n\\nThanks to all the amazing responses to my post, I will never do justice to trying to answer them all but know that I have and will read them all and each one gives me more strength and confidence tonight this thing. /Edit\\n\\n\\nSo I wrote out this incredibly long, detailed, essay  of my diagnosis story and then decided to just say this. (I did save it though in case I ever do decide to post it.) I found out 3 weeks ago that I have invasive triple negative breast cancer after finding a lump in my left breast very near my armpit. It is very fast growing, ki67 was 95 and the core samples was exclusively cancer cells. No breast tissue found. Of course, no lymph node cells found either, so that seemed at least hopeful.\\n\\nI get my ~~USB~~chemo port ~~installed~~placed next Thursday and start a year of chemo/immunotherapy the following Monday.  I am slated to get surgery in 6 months.\\n\\nBreast MRI yesterday showed signs of lymph node involvement so rather than waiting to do a sentinel biopsy during surgery, they're sending me for another ultrasound of the lymph nodes to determine whether it needs a biopsy now. They also found a sizeable \\\"nonmass\\\" enhancement (whatever that means) in my right breast that I now have to go get an MRI guided biopsy for. That was set at Bi Rads 4, which maybe is just because I already definitely have cancer? That's what I'm telling myself, anyway.\\n\\nI'm single, and my amazing children are all adults. Unfortunately they all live on the other side of the state which is 2 hours away, but they've already started brainstorming ways to be supportive. They're so amazing. I called the local community cancer support center and am waiting to hear back from a client specialist so that I can maybe get into some support and activity groups. \\n\\nMentally I'm doing okay. I'm sad, and scared of course, but also optimistic. I'm already planning funky hair colors that will make my kids declare me to be in midlife crisis. The hardest part emotionally is how exhausted I am physically. I have been dealing with fatigue for years, with it worsening considerably over this spring and summer. My oncologist says she's not sure how much of it is related because she thinks I caught this thing extremely early, like probably within weeks of it forming, but related or not, this fatigue is the worst I've ever felt in my life. Today I literally woke up after 9 hours of sleep, let my dog out (and back in) and laid on the couch and was napping in less than 30 minutes. I slept for about 3 hours. I finally forced myself off the couch and went to the grocery store for 10 minutes before coming home, putting the bag of groceries in the fridge, bag and all, and laying back down for another 2.5 hour nap. Now bedtime isn't far off and I feel confident I'll sleep all night. How do I function like this? There are so many things I want to do and need to get done but I feel like I can barely find the energy to breathe. \\n\\nIt also just keeps re-occurring to me that this is a Thing. This isn't, oh, you have high cholesterol, eat better and it will be fine. Or even, man, that's a bad case of the flu, it sucks now but it will be a distant memory by the end of the month. Like it hits me, over and over. Oh shit. I have cancer. And then I \\\"forget\\\" again. \\n\\nI'm rambling, possibly because I'm stoned and overtired. Anyway, that's me.

We sought out the world\\u2019s leading specialist in the disease and he saved my life. I had surgery to remove my lung , had heated chemo during surgery, had 4 sessions of chemo and 30 sessions of radiation .. and it worked. They told me I had 15 months to live. \\nI always say survivorship is a shitshow.. it certainly isn\\u2019t what I expected, but I am forever grateful to still be here, even with all of the lasting issues due to my surgery and treatment . \\nSomeone told me that gratitude and grief can exist in the same place at the same time, and that really helped me to sort through all of the emotions that come with surviving cancer\\u2026 \\nI just wanted to celebrate with others who understand \\u2026\",\n          \"A major consequence of prolonged chemotherapy that nobody seems to acknowledge in the medical community is tooth decay. I had 3 years of chemo and radiation in my teens during the early 2000's, and almost all of my teeth have rotted away at this point. It didn't seem to matter how well I took care of them, they just got worse and worse every year. Tooth abscess, cavity, pain. Slowly and slowly they just got worse and now I'm having to look at implants and dentures. So what are the reasons for this?\\n\\nThe reason that I have seen some cancer websites, and doctors warn of is dry mouth. While it has been well established that dry mouth greatly contributes to cavity development, it is certainly not present after chemo is over. So what's the real reason? Vomit. When I was on chemo I vomited anywhere from 4 to 10 times a day for the better part of 2 years. Sometimes I vomited so many times and so hard that the stomach bile came up after many dry heaves. Stomach acid is literally hydrochloric acid. It eats away the protective coating of your teeth, and causes microscopic pitting in the enamel that is not stripped away. This is also the result for people with bulimia.\\n\\nNow I am a unique case. I also received radiation therapy to my head and neck area, which before current technology, could also cause weakening in teeth. It was a really bad combo for me. \\n\\nThis is why it is vitally important to see a dentist regularly after treatment is over. You can still die from tooth and jaw infections even In current day first world countries. \\n\\nThat's one of my rarely talked about cancer treatment stories, what about you? What else would you like to warn people to watch out for?\",\n          \"I am a childhood cancer survivor. I had rhabdomyosarcoma and went through chemotherapy for 9months. It came back 6mons into remission. I had another round of chemo for 9months and 2weeks of radiation. My hair is very thin, and I\\u2019ve seen the tiniest amount of thickness develop. I am incredibly insecure about it and have tried multiple hair products. Can anyone please help me find something that will bring my hair back, or at least thick enough to completely cover my scalp?

When it spread to an organ\\n2. When it's time for her to enter hospice\\n3. When she's gone\\n\\nEvery appointment I've attended with her oncologist, I've been dreading and trying to brace myself for the news that one of those 3 moments might happen.  In the first meeting with them after her diagnosis, they told us that we would eventually have one of those meetings.  I knew from the first meeting that remission wasn't an option, so when the first medication stopped preventing new lesions from forming, it didn't hit me as hard.  There are tiers and alternatives and a variety of attack plans to hold back things and give her as much time as possible.  There were options.\\n\\nThis last Wednesday she went in for a PET scan, and the next day she had a telehealth appointment with her oncologist.  Nothing out of the ordinary, happens every couple of months.  It was over the phone, so I didn't join in on the call.\\n\\nShe came out, told me that she was just told that it has spread to her liver, and I held her while she cried.  Thankfully, me knowing this would happen at some point allowed me to give her space to feel and express the rage, fear, and sadness with someone who wouldn't try to eclipse it with their own.  \\n\\nNow that I'm at work and don't have to put on a brave face for her, I'm realizing that I was not prepared enough for my own anger and disappointment.  Her friends and other family keep putting off spending time with her because it's inconvenient and hard to spend time with her.  I get that it's overwhelming for them, but life is a series of overwhelming incidents with spaces of healing in between.\\n\\nI wish I had the means to do more myself for and with her, but I can't do everything she wants.  She wants to travel with her friends, she wants to be silly with her family and siblings, she wants to fall in love, she wants to just be 25, and not \\\"25 with terminal cancer\\\", even if just for a short while.  \\n\\nThat last appointment was a harsh reminder that the window to even make that possible is closing.  The medications that have held this thing at bay for over a year are starting to fail.  Her fractured vertebra are collapsing more, she has other lesions that have compromised her hips to where she might have a fracture there at any moment.\\n\\nI knew this was coming, and I'm angry that I fooled myself into thinking I had more time.\",\n          \"I posted a few months ago about my dad being diagnosed. We didn\\u2019t know the stage just that the mass they removed was cancerous. His cancer is extremely rare and there\\u2019s only a few specialists who even know about it, let alone enough to diagnose a stage. But it\\u2019s stage 4, 2 new masses. Found out today. No treatment and he doesn\\u2019t want to live a life where he\\u2019s sick all the time just for a few months so he is opting out of whatever clinical trials or brutal chemo that\\u2019s available. \\n\\nHe\\u2019s one of the best people I know. He\\u2019s my dad, of course I think that. I\\u2019m happy to have been blessed with so many years with him. All the memories and stories I have with and from him. I want to enjoy the time we have left and support my mom when he\\u2019s passed on. Life doesn\\u2019t make sense, it isn\\u2019t fair, nobody actually knows what this is or where we go, if anywhere. Hug them if they\\u2019re here, say their name and keep them alive if they aren\\u2019t, talk to them and maybe they can hear it.

They\\u2019re trying to schedule a day to come evaluate. \\n\\nMy heart sunk to my stomach as we drove home.. I knew it was coming but DAMN MAN\\u2026 I thought they would have atleast given her a TPN.. \\n\\nFast forward to today, considering she was on palliative care and we already had a visit scheduled, Her blood pressure i believe was 90/60something. It\\u2019s been getting lower and lower these past 2 weeks. Her pain meds were no longer effective ( Hycet) we\\u2019re on liquid morphine now.
